## Describe the improvement you'd like to bring
A clear and concise description of what the optimization is about.
E.g. "The way data is loaded from DB is now inefficient because [...]. It can simply improved by [...]".

### Explain why it would be helpful
Brief on how the optimization will help the project:
1. It will allow the webpage to load x% faster, beacause '...'
2. User experience will benefit from '...'
3. Given 1. and 2., one may expect '...'

### Explain how it would work
An overview on how the optimization will work in the project:
1. Instead of doing '...', we can do '...'
2. Using strings rather than objects one can achieve '...'

## Describe how to implement the optimization
If you have any hints on how to integrate it in the project, add them here.

### Existing features it is based on
If the optimization is based on a specific feature, reference it here. If available, also mention original feature request issue.

### Code references
Please, complete the following information about the code version you are basing your observation on:
 - Version tag (if any): [e.g. v1.2.3]
 - Branch (if version is not provided): [e.g. `main`]
 - Commit hash (if version is not provided, and commit is not latest on branch): [e.g. abc1234]

Please, add details about the files and methods involved:
 - Relevant files: [e.g. App.vue, coolFolder/coolFunctions.ts]
 - Relevant functions: [e.g. myClass.unoptimized()]
 - Worth mentioning: [e.g. see TODO at line 123]
