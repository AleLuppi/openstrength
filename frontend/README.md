# Frontend

Frontend part of the project.


## How to use

Run the following commands *from inside `frontend` folder*.

### Project setup
Install all the dependencies.
```
npm install
```

### Compile and hot-reload for development
Start a local server with hot-reload enabled.
```
npm run serve
```

### Compile and minify for production
Prepare a compiled folder, ready for production release.
```
npm run build
```

### Lint and fix files
Run linter to clean code. Run it before commit (or enable auto-lint on update).
```
npm run lint
```

### Deploy on Firebase
> **Note:** login to Firebase is required via `firebase login`

Test web app in a dedicated channel. Deploy it and get the temporary link (`CHANNEL_ID` can be any valid name).
```
npm run release -- CHANNEL_ID
```
Deploy the web app on Firebase's hosting domains.
```
npm run deploy
```
Optionally, it is possible to deploy other services too (database, storage, firestore, functions), separated by commas. See documentation for more details: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys).
